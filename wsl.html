<h1>WSL <span class="italic">(Windoze Subsystem for Linux)</span></h1>
<h2>Work in progress</h2>
<p>This page is a <span style="italic">work in progress</span>.  Check back later!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I think I tried WSL a few years ago and wasn't especially impressed.  At work, I have a Windoze laptop and would do a lot of <span class="italic">real work</span> on a Openstack Linux machine.</p>
<p>I made a lot of use of VSCode's Remote SSH plugin to edit files on the Linux machine from the laptop but would occasionally have trouble with it working for me.  In 2024, VSCode was causing me grief because the server code was taking over the remote CPU and it became so intolerable that I stopped using VSCode for a while.  I asked colleagues with whom I worked if they had better solutions on Windoze laptops and someone said they used WSL.  I asked him some more questions and it sounded very encouraging so I checked it out.</p>
<p>Now I'm basically doing all of my work on the WSL machine.</p>
<h3>Why Windoze???</h3>
<p>At my current job, employees are given the choice of Mac or Windoze laptops.  I'm a contractor and I don't even think they gave me a choice when I first started a couple of years ago - I just got Windoze.  I've heard that contractors aren't even allowed to request Macs for some reason - I think there was another contractor on my team who was assigned a Mac but eventually had to return it for Windoze for some stupid reason.  I don't even have that much experience with Macs and don't know if I would like it or not.</p>

<p>I had to enable virtualization from my laptop's BIOS:</p>

<p>I even had to look up tips from the Internet to bring up the BIOS menu so your mileage may vary!</p>
<h3><span class="monospaced">wsl</span> man page</h3>
<p>I couldn't find a decent <span class="italic">man page</span> of the <span class="monospaced">wsl</span> command so I captured the online help and saved in <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pfuntner/7055ea04c84199fed503c1a2798b4378/raw/5eba5215296595e54bf526b27850424e47304e03/wsl-man.txt">a Gist file</a>.</p>

<h2>Likes</h2>
<p>There are some things I like about WSL.
<h3>Access to Windoze files</h3>
<p>The WSL machine has a different filespace but one of the most attractive things about WSL was the fact that I could easily get to any file in the Windows space. You just have to start the path with <span class="monospaced">/mnt/c/</span>.</p>
<p>For instance, you can run the Windoze Notepad app via <span class="monospaced">/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/notepad.exe</span>.  <span class="bold">However</span>, because WSL has a different file space so although you can <span class="italic">start</span> Notepad, you can't use it to <span class="italic">edit</span> a file in the WSL file space!  Still, there's a huge benefit to access to Windoze files.</p>
<h4>Symbolic links</h4>
<p>I've actually set up symbolic links to some important files and directories which actually live in the Window space.  For example, for years, I've used <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> instead of a Windoze command prompt and have some Github repos in Windows - some directories are present in my <span class="monospaced">PATH</span>!  Rather than duplicate the repos, I use symlinks:
</p>
<pre class="indent smaller-text">
ln -sv /mnt/c/cygwin64/home/mrbruno/repos ~/repos
</pre>
<p>I host most of my Github repos in Windows, set up one or more symlinks, and edit them in WSL with <span class="monospaced">vi</span>.  I can also edit the repos with VSCode and it's all very seamless.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Dislikes</h2>
<p>There are some things I <span class="bold">do not like</span> about WSL.
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>My biggest complaint has to be VPN.  I'm mostly using WSL on my work laptop and I have to be on VPN to get to my company's network.  It doesn't appear as though the WSL team put any thought at all into working with VPN and I'm not the only person who has had trouble.  You'll find all sorts of posts and tips about what to do and I didn't find a single <span class="italic">silver bullet</span>.  I eventually got it working but I basically had to use <span class="monospaced">/etc/resolv.conf</span> from a colleague at work who got WSL working.</p>
<h3>Network performance</h3>
<p>I'm used to using Linux on an Openstack machine hosted by the company for whom I work.  I would <span class="monospaced">ssh</span> in and the command prompt is all I need.  Compared to WSL, network-intensive operations (for instance, pulling a Docker image or downloading a large tarball) can take much longer.  Not only do operations depend more on your ISP but there's your home network (possibly WiFi). The point is these devices likely don't process traffic at the same speed as commercial equipment.  When I was using Openstack, the data never had to reach my laptop!</p>
<h4>Side-by-side comparison</h4>
I want to compare performance of a large file on WSL compared to Openstack.  I am choosing to use <a href="https://mirror.vtti.vt.edu/almalinux/9.3/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9-latest-x86_64-dvd.iso">AlmaLinux-9-latest-x86_64-dvd.iso</a> (10,916,724,736 bytes, 11GB, md5sum: <span class="monospaced">c78e2b04410f98fa1a29f2b0b8e60077</span>) because it's quite large.  I'm also using <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli">speedtest-cli</a> to measure the speed.

<p>You may have noticed that I didn't include the speedtest result.  That's because it didn't work.  I figure there are firewall rules set up at my work Openstack host so speedtest can't reach its servers:</p>

<p>
But you can see that there's a serious difference in time.
</p>
<h3>Lack of a <span class="italic">real</span> <span class="monospaced">cron</span> service</h3>
<p>Sure, WSL has commands like <span class="monospaced">crontab</span> and even a <span class="monospaced">cron</span> service but what good is it when you shut your laptop down??  I miss a real <span class="monospaced">cron</span> service on my Openstack machine... although I didn't have a lot of cronjobs and recently lost the need to have those... it's a long story but I've shifted from using persistent cloud credentials to credentials that are only good for eight hours... the cronjobs depended on the credentials so I've already disabled the cronjobs.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>I learned some other tips you might find useful with WSL.
<h3>Avoid the <span class="monospaced">shutdown</span> command!</h3>
<p>Lately I've found <span class="monospaced">shutdown -r 1</span> to be the easiest way to do a reboot a Linux machine and recover control of your shell before the reboot but you should avoid the command in WSL.</p>
<p>The first time I experimented with <span class="monospaced">shutdown</span> on WSL, I had trouble starting it back up again!</p>

<p>I thought it might not recover until I rebooted... possibly, some intervention had to take place!  But eventually <span class="italic">(after at least 15 minutes, I think!)</span> it worked fine.  In contrast, a <span class="italic">simple</span> reboot on a <span class="italic">real</span> Linux machine only takes a minute or two.</p>
<p>See <a href="#wsl_shutdown"><span class="italic">WSL Shutdown</span></a> for a better way to restart WSL.</p>
<h3 id="wsl_shutdown">WSL Shutdown</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62314789/no-internet-connection-on-wsl-ubuntu-windows-subsystem-for-linux"><span class="italic">No internet connection on WSL Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</span></a>, I learned this is a good command to restart WSL (if necessary):</p>
<pre class="indent smaller-text">
wsl --shutdown
</pre>
<h3>Running Windoze commands from inside WSL</h3>
<p>I’ve seen this in various posts including <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62314789/no-internet-connection-on-wsl-ubuntu-windows-subsystem-for-linux"><span class="italic">No internet connection on WSL Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</span></a>:</p>
<pre class="indent smaller-text">
$ /mnt/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe -Command 'Get-DnsClientGlobalSetting | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SuffixSearchList'
foo.com
$
</pre>
<p>I think this is useful enough to set up an alias:</p>
<pre class="indent smaller-text">
$ grep windows .bashrc
alias windows='/mnt/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe'
$ windows -Command 'Get-DnsClientGlobalSetting | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SuffixSearchList'
foo.com
$
</pre>
<p>Look at that! I didn’t even use my regular nickname for Windoze! I’m not sure if this is only for PowerShell or what. Frankly, at this point, I still don’t understand the difference between PowerShell and the regular Wiundoze command prompt - and I don't really care enough to learn the difference.  I don't have a need to know the difference and there's a lot of other stuff I would rather learn.</p>
<h3>Running WSL commands from Windoze</h3>
<p>You can run a Linux command directly from a Windoze command prompt:</p>
