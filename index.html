<h2>Getting started with GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I'm still new to GitHub Pages <span class="italic">(aka github.io)</span>.  I created <a href="old-index">My first page</a> to try things out.  I actually used it as the main page for while before I came up with other plans for the pages.</p>
<h2>WSL <span class="italic">(Windoze Subsystem for Linux)</span></h2>
<p>Recently at work I've started using WSL and I've put together some <a href="wsl">tips and thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: there are some things I like and some I don't but, in general, it's a good environment.  If you want the Linux look & feel <span class="bold">and</span> access to you Windoze files, check it out!</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>I enjoy some online board and strategy games.  Here are some useful links:
<ul>
<li><a href="crosssums-cheatsheet.html">Cross Sums cheat sheet</a> - I call it a <span class="italic">cheat sheet</span> but I suppose it's really not.  It's just a list of all combinations of digits that will add up to a particular sum.  I will use it when working on a puzzle to help me figure out cells in a puzzle.  The pattern of combinations for a certain number of digits is very interesting!  If you're not familiar with Cross Sums (aka Kakuro), check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro">Wikipedia</a> page.  Personally, I've never heard it called anything except Cross Sums but it might be a regional thing.  The USA is still using the imperial system rather than the metric system!</li>

<li><a href="images/hexversi-axes.png">Hexversi axes labeling</a> - <a href="http://itsyourturn.com">ItsYourTurn</a> has a great Reversi/Othello variation called Hexversi where the cells and the board are in the shape of hexagons.  It's fun but the worse part is that the intersecting axes are diagonal and not labeled.
<br/><br/>This image attempts to label the axes:
<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>The axes with letters (<span class="italic">A</span> through <span class="italic">K</span>) go from the upper left and upper edges to the lower and lower right edges</li>
        <br/>
        <li>The axes with numbers (<span class="italic">1</span> through <span class="italic">11</span>) go from the lower and lower left edges to the upper right and upper edges</li>
    </ul>
<br/>I labeled three hexes as examples.  Note that <span class="italic">C6</span> and <span class="italic">I6</span> are on the same long <span class="italic">6</span> diagonal.  The other long diagonal is <span class="italic">F</span></li>
