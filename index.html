<h2>Getting started with GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I'm still new to GitHub Pages <span class="italic">(aka github.io)</span>.  I created <a href="old-index">My first page</a> to try things out.  I actually used it as the main page for while before I came up with other plans for the pages.</p>
<h2>WSL <span class="italic">(Windoze Subsystem for Linux)</span></h2>
<p>Recently at work I've started using WSL and I've put together some <a href="wsl">tips and thoughts</a>.</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>I enjoy some online board and strategy games.  Here are some useful links:
<ul>
<li><a href="crosssums-cheatsheet.html">Cross Sums cheat sheet</a> - I call it a <span class="italic">cheat sheet</span> but I suppose it's really not.  It's just a list of all combinations of digits that will add up to a particular sum.  I will use it when working on a puzzle to help me figure out cells in a puzzle.</li>
<li><a href="images/hexversi-axes.png">Hexversi axes labeling</a> - <a href="http://itsyourturn.com">ItsYourTurn</a> has a great Reversi/Othello variation called Hexversi where the cells and the board are in the shape of hexagons.  It's fun but the worse part is that the intersecting axes are diagonal and not labeled.  This image attempts to labeled the axes.  I labeled three hexes as examples.  Note that C6 and I6 are on the same long <span class="italic">6</span> diagonal.</li>
