<h2>Getting started with GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I'm still new to GitHub Pages <span class="italic">(aka github.io)</span>.  I created <a href="old-index">My first page</a> to try things out.  I actually used it as the main page for while before I came up with other plans for the pages.</p>
<h2>WSL <span class="italic">(Windoze Subsystem for Linux)</span></h2>
<p>Recently at work I've started using WSL and I've put together some <a href="wsl">tips and thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: there are some things I like and some I don't but, in general, it's a good environment.  If you want the Linux look & feel <span class="bold">and</span> access to your Windoze files, check it out!</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>I enjoy some online board and strategy games.  Here are some useful links:
<ul>
<li><a href="crosssums-cheatsheet.html">Cross Sums cheat sheet</a> - I call it a <span class="italic">cheat sheet</span> but I suppose it's really not.  It's just a list of all combinations of digits that will add up to a particular sum.  I will use it when working on a puzzle to help me figure out cells in a puzzle.  The pattern of combinations for a certain number of digits is very interesting!  If you're not familiar with Cross Sums (aka Kakuro), check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro">Wikipedia</a> page.  Personally, I've never heard it called anything except Cross Sums but it might be a regional thing.  The USA is still using the imperial system rather than the metric system!</li>
